# Crazy Tetris

A modified version of Tetris with random gravity flips and other unpredictable elements!

## How to Play

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Use the arrow keys to move the falling pieces.
3.  Use the "Q" and "W" keys to rotate the pieces.
4.  Press the spacebar to flip the gravity direction randomly.
5.  Try to clear lines by filling rows with blocks.
6.  Survive as long as you can!

## Controls

*   **Left Arrow:** Move piece left
*   **Right Arrow:** Move piece right
*   **Down Arrow:** Drop piece faster
*   **Q:** Rotate piece counter-clockwise
*   **W:** Rotate piece clockwise
*   **Spacebar:** Flip gravity direction

## "Crazy" Features

*   **Random Gravity Flips:** The direction of gravity changes randomly, making it harder to predict where the pieces will fall.
*   (Add more crazy features here as you implement them, e.g., variable falling speeds, randomized rotation, etc.)
